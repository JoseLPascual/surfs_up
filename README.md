## Project OVerview
Willem Nestorius Avy, a.k.a. W. Avy, has tasked me with analyzing temperature trends for the months of June and December for the Hawaiian island (and county) of Oahu, the purpose of which is to determine the year-round economic sustainability of his surf and ice cream shop business.

## Resources
-- Data Sources: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, hawaii.sqlite
-- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.57.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 (with Python 3.7.6)

## Results
Upon conducting the analysis, the following results were found:
-The lowest recorded temperature found was for December, measuring in at 58 degrees, while the lowest temperature for June was measured at 65 degrees, a spread of 7 degrees.
-The highest recorded temperature found was for June, measuring in at 85 degrees, while the highest temperature for December was measured at 80 degrees, a spread of 5 degrees.
-The median recorded temperature for June was 74 degrees, while for December, its median recorded temperature was 71 degrees, a spread of 3 degrees.
-One-fourths of all recorded temperatures for the month of December were found to be no higher than 68 degrees, indicating a 11-degree spread between that and the lowest recorded temperature for that month.

## Challenge Summary
Given how there is a 1-in-4 chance of temperatures falling between 58 degrees and 68 degrees during the month of December in Oahu, I conclude that it would not be feasible for W. Avy to operate his surf and ice cream shop business during the month of December.  However, with temperatures falling no lower than 65 degrees during June, and with three-fourths of all recorded temperatures falling no lower than 73 degrees then, his business during the summer may proceed as usual.
